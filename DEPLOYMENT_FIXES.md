# Vercel Deployment Fixes Summary

This document summarizes all the fixes applied to resolve deployment issues on Vercel.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. JSON Parsing Error ✅ FIXED
**Error**: `SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<', "<!doctype "... is not valid JSON`

**Root Cause**: Server actions were trying to construct API URLs using environment variables that weren't available, causing fetch calls to hit 404 pages that returned HTML instead of JSON.

**Solutions Applied**:
- **Enhanced URL construction logic** in `app/actions/serverActions.ts`
  - Added multiple fallback strategies for getting Vercel URLs
  - Added support for `VERCEL_URL`, `VERCEL_PROJECT_PRODUCTION_URL`, `VERCEL_BRANCH_URL`
  - Added better error handling to detect HTML vs JSON responses
- **Switched to client-side API calls** in `components/InputForm.tsx`
  - Changed from server actions to direct `fetch()` calls using relative URLs
  - More reliable in Vercel environment
- **Added detailed logging** for debugging URL construction issues

### 2. File System Error ✅ FIXED
**Error**: `EROFS: read-only file system, open '/var/task/tmp/downloads/...'`

**Root Cause**: Vercel functions run in a read-only file system where only the `/tmp` directory is writable. The code was trying to create directories under `process.cwd() + '/tmp'` which is read-only.

**Solutions Applied**:
- **Updated temp directory paths** in:
  - `app/api/analyze/video/route.ts`
  - `app/api/analyze/video-file/route.ts`
- **Changed from**: `const tmpDir = path.join(process.cwd(), 'tmp')`
- **Changed to**: `const tmpDir = '/tmp'`

### 3. Function Configuration ✅ ADDED
**Created `vercel.json`** to configure function limits:
- **Max Duration**: 300 seconds (5 minutes) for video analysis endpoints
- **Memory**: 3008 MB (max available) for processing large video files
- **Scope**: Applied to both video URL and video file analysis routes

## Files Modified

### Core Functionality
- ✅ `app/actions/serverActions.ts` - Enhanced URL construction and error handling
- ✅ `components/InputForm.tsx` - Switched to client-side API calls
- ✅ `app/api/analyze/video/route.ts` - Fixed file system paths
- ✅ `app/api/analyze/video-file/route.ts` - Fixed file system paths

### Configuration
- ✅ `vercel.json` - Added function timeout and memory configuration

### Documentation  
- ✅ `VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive deployment guide
- ✅ `DEPLOYMENT_FIXES.md` - This summary document

## Deployment Checklist

Before deploying, ensure:

### Environment Variables
- ✅ Enable "Automatically expose System Environment Variables" in Vercel project settings
- ✅ Set all required API keys:
  - `OPENAI_API_KEY`
  - `SIEVE_API_KEY`
  - `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID`
  - `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PRIVATE_KEY`
  - `GOOGLE_CLOUD_CLIENT_EMAIL`
  - `GOOGLE_CLOUD_STORAGE_BUCKET`

### Vercel Plan Considerations
- **Hobby Plan**: 10-second timeout (may not work for video analysis)
- **Pro Plan**: 60-second timeout (recommended minimum)
- **Enterprise Plan**: 15-minute timeout (ideal for large videos)

### Testing Steps
1. Deploy the application
2. Test URL analysis with a short YouTube video
3. Check browser console for proper URL construction logs:
   ```
   🌐 Using origin for API call: https://your-app.vercel.app
   📡 Making API call to: https://your-app.vercel.app/api/analyze/video
   ```
4. Verify files are being created in `/tmp` directory (check function logs)

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

### Video URL Analysis
- ✅ Proper API endpoint resolution
- ✅ Files saved to `/tmp/downloads/`, `/tmp/audio/`, `/tmp/chunks/`
- ✅ Detailed progress logging
- ✅ Graceful error handling with specific error messages

### File Upload Analysis
- ✅ Direct file processing without server action issues
- ✅ Proper temporary file management
- ✅ Memory-efficient processing for large files

### Error Handling
- ✅ Clear distinction between API errors and routing issues
- ✅ Helpful error messages for debugging
- ✅ Proper cleanup of temporary files

## Performance Optimizations Applied

1. **Client-side API calls** - Reduced server-side complexity
2. **Efficient file cleanup** - Prevents `/tmp` directory bloat
3. **Optimized memory usage** - Configured maximum available memory
4. **Extended timeouts** - Allows for complete video processing

## Monitoring Recommendations

After deployment, monitor:
- Function execution times (should be under 5 minutes for most videos)
- Memory usage (should not exceed 3GB)
- Error rates (should be minimal with proper error handling)
- API key usage and quotas

## Support

If you encounter issues after applying these fixes:
1. Check the browser console for client-side errors
2. Review Vercel function logs for server-side issues
3. Verify all environment variables are set correctly
4. Ensure your Vercel plan supports the required timeout duration
